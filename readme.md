Business case:
Our bot is able to transmit up-to-date information about the value of cryptocurrencies, which can become a useful tool for crypto financiers right in their pocket.

How it works:
The code is divided into two parts (two monsters): the first one collects information and updates it in our database. The second one reacts to the user's messages and gives the user information on request.

How to start the bot:
- start grabber_init.py
- start main.py
